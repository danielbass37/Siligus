# [Siligus.com](http://www.siligus.com) - Daniel Bass Portfolio

A Windows 95-inspired portfolio website showcasing my work in Product Marketing, and a new hobby I picked up 3 days ago (23/03/2025).

## About This Project

This portfolio website is designed with a nostalgic Windows 95 aesthetic, featuring:

- Interactive desktop with clickable icons
- Windows-style dialog boxes for different content sections
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices
- Video projects showcase
- Blog posts and newsletter integration
- Resume/CV viewer
- More soon I think!

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- [React95](https://github.com/react95-io/React95) (Windows 95 UI components)
- [Cursor AI](https://www.cursor.com/)
- CSS for custom styling

## Deployment

This site is deployed using Netlify with continuous integration from GitHub. Any changes pushed to the main branch will automatically trigger a new build and deployment.
