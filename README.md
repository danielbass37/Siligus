A Windows 95-inspired portfolio website showcasing my work in Product Marketing and the new hobby I picked up 3 (23/03/2025) days ago - 
Playing around with Cursor.

## About This Project

- Interactive desktop with clickable icons
- Windows-style dialog boxes for different content sections
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile devices
- Video projects showcase
- Blog posts and newsletter integration
- Resume/CV viewer
- GooseAmp (It plays one song from YouTube)
- More soon I think!

## Technologies Used
